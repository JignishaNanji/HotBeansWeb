 </h3></div>
 <div class="p">
Hot Beans Web was set up in 2009 by Jeniffer because of her passion for web development. She decided to set up the business after he couldn’t find anywhere to create her ideal website, so she thought she could do it better.

In 2011, Jeniffer finally moved the business from a small office in Chobham to a bigger office in Farnborough Business Park, which allowed her to expand the business and increase the number of clients we have.

Now in 2019, Hot Beans Web works for several companies and provides the best experience possible. We are always looking to grow, so check out the job openings to see if you can join the Hot Beans Web family.</div>
